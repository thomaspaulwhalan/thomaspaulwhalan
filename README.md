- 👋 Hi, I’m @thomaspaulwhalan
- 👀 I’m interested in programming in C, playing guitar, and working in my shop.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular as I'm just learning, but if something arises that I can help with, I will.
- 📫 I can be reached on Discord at networktom's server
